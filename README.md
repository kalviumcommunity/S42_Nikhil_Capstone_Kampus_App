## Project Idea & Brief Description

**Project Title:** Kampus App - Kalvian's Management System

**Description:**
The Kampus App is a web-based application designed to make student management processes easier and more effective. It offers many features to improve communication, simplify tasks, and make learning better for students, mentors, and administrators. From signing up for classes and managing schedules to tracking assignments and having discussions, the Kampus App provides a central place for smooth teamwork and sharing information. By using technology, this project aims to update old student management methods and create a friendly environment that encourages learning and growth. The Kampus App wants to be the best solution for schools looking for a complete system for student management and teamwork.

## Problem Statement

Many schools find it hard to manage student information and academic tasks because they use many separate systems, manual processes, and have slow ways of communicating. This often leads to extra work, mistakes in information, and a less-than-great experience for students and teachers.

## Proposed Solution

The Kampus App aims to solve these problems by offering a single, easy-to-use, and accessible platform. It will automate everyday tasks, make sure information is correct, improve communication, and give real-time updates on student progress and school operations. It specifically helps by providing central tools for enrollment, scheduling, assignments, and strong communication, moving beyond older ways of doing things.

## Key Features

The Kampus App comes with helpful features for everyone at school:

* **User Registration and Login:** Secure ways for students, mentors, and administrators to sign up and log in.

* **Dashboard/Homepage for Personalized Experience:** A special home screen for each user to quickly see what's important to them.

* **Enrollment and Registration Management:** Simple ways to sign up for courses.

* **Schedule Management:** Tools to help manage and view class times and important dates.

* **Assignment and Quiz Management:** Features for teachers to give assignments and quizzes, and for students to submit them.

* **Discussions and Messaging:** Ways to talk and share ideas with others in groups or privately.

* **Announcements and Notifications:** Important messages and alerts to keep everyone updated.

* **Ticketing System:** A place to ask for help and track support requests.

* **Account Settings:** Options for users to change their personal information.

## Tech Stack

The Kampus App is built using modern technologies:

**Backend:**

* **Node.js**: For building the server (the part that handles data and logic).

* **Express.js**: A framework that helps Node.js build web applications quickly.

* **SQL Database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)**: For storing all the information in an organized way.

**Frontend:**

* **React**: A library for building the user interface (what you see and click on).

* **Redux**: Helps manage the information that the app uses.

* **JavaScript, HTML, CSS**: The basic languages for creating web pages and making them look good.

## Target Users

The Kampus App is made for different people in an educational setting:

* **Students:** To manage their classes, assignments, and schedules, and to talk with friends and teachers.

* **Mentors (Faculty/Teachers):** To manage courses, create assignments, see how students are doing, and join discussions.

* **Administrators (Administrative Staff):** To handle student sign-ups, manage schedules, deal with support tickets, and send out announcements.

## Benefits

Using the Kampus App brings many good things to schools:

* **Efficiency:** It automates tasks, meaning less manual work for everyone.

* **Accessibility:** All important information is in one place, available anytime, anywhere, which is great for learning from home or school.

* **Transparency:** You can see schedules, assignments, grades, and announcements in real-time, making everything clear.

* **Day 3: User Authentication Backend & Initial Frontend Integration:** I will build the server-side code for user registration and login, including secure password handling and user identification. On the frontend, I'll set up my React project and connect it to manage user login status.

* **Day 4: Frontend UI - Login, Registration & Basic Dashboard:** I will create the visual parts (pages) for users to log in and sign up. I'll connect these pages to the server to handle user accounts and create a simple dashboard that only logged-in users can see.

* **Day 5: User Profile Management (Backend):** I will create server-side tools for getting, updating, and deleting user profiles. I'll make sure only the right people can change profiles.

* **Day 6: User Profile Management (Frontend):** I will build the user-facing pages where users can see and change their details like name and email. This will connect to the server to fetch and update information.

* **Day 7: Week 1 Review & Refinement:** I will check all the code from the first week, making sure it's easy to read and works well. I'll fix any problems related to logging in, user profiles, or the dashboard.

### Week 2: Enrollment & Scheduling Features (Days 8-14)

* **Day 8: Course Management (Backend):** I will create server-side tools for managing courses. This will let administrators add, read, update, and delete course information.

* **Day 9: Course Management & Enrollment (Frontend):** I will build a special page for administrators to manage courses. For students, I'll create a page to browse available courses and sign up for them.

* **Day 10: Enrollment Management & Schedule Data Model:** I will create server-side tools for managing student enrollments. I'll also design the detailed database structure for schedules, linking courses, mentors, and students with times and places.

* **Day 11: Schedule Management (Backend):** I will develop server-side tools for managing schedules. This will let administrators and mentors create, update, and delete schedule entries, making sure there are no time conflicts.

* **Day 12: Schedule Viewing (Frontend):** I will create a page where students can see their own schedules, and mentors can see their teaching schedules. I'll add options to filter schedules by week or day.

* **Day 13: Advanced Schedule & Enrollment Features:** I will improve the schedule conflict detection on the server. I'll also add features for mentors and administrators to view and filter enrollment lists.

* **Day 14: Week 2 Review & Refinement:** I will thoroughly check all the course, enrollment, and scheduling features. I'll fix any problems and make sure all related information is correct.

### Week 3: Assignment & Communication Features (Part 1) (Days 15-21)
